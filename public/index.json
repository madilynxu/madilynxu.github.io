[{"content":"E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis \u0026amp; Prediction Project Overview The goal of this project is to predict customer churn and perform customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform. By identifying at-risk customers, it provides insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention. Additionally, customer segmentation is performed to tailor strategies for different customer groups, enhancing the platform\u0026rsquo;s retention efforts.\nClick the GitHub Repository for more details!\nKey Insights Churn Prediction: The churn rate across the 5,630 customers is 16.84%, with a key predictor being the customerâ€™s tenure.\nThe most important predictors of churn include tenure, cash back amount, complaints, and order categories.\nModel Performance: The XGBoost model performed best with a recall score of 98%, successfully identifying the majority of at-risk customers.\nCompared models: Logistic Regression (79% recall), SVM (94% recall), Random Forest (93% recall), and Stacking (92% recall).\nA final XGBoost model was selected for its strong performance and low computational complexity.\nCustomer Segmentation: Using K-Means clustering and RFM analysis, customers were segmented into four groups: Occasional Shoppers, Premium Enthusiasts, Price-conscious Bargain Hunters, and Loyal Regulars.\nTailored strategies were proposed for each segment, such as \u0026ldquo;Perfect for You\u0026rdquo; campaigns for occasional shoppers and VIP experiences for premium enthusiasts.\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV): High-value customers (with CLV \u0026gt; $373.33) have lower churn rates (5.44%).\nA significant portion of the potential churn is from high-value customers, with a revenue loss potential of $20,776.83.\nRecommendations Focus on high-value customers: Implement personalized programs for customers with a CLV above $373.33, as they have lower churn rates and higher revenue potential.\nSegment-specific retention strategies: Develop tailored campaigns for each customer segment based on their unique behaviors and preferences.\nImprove feature tracking: Include additional metrics like product return history and customer referral activity for better churn prediction.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/customer-churn-analysis/","summary":"Predicting customer churn and performing customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform","title":"E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis \u0026 Prediction"},{"content":"Remote Work on Mental Health Introduction The \u0026ldquo;Remote Work \u0026amp; Mental Health\u0026rdquo; project analyzes how different work environments (onsite, hybrid, and remote) affect employees\u0026rsquo; mental health, stress levels, work-life balance, and productivity across various industries.\nClick the GitHub Repository for more details!\nKey Insights Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health: Onsite Work leads to the highest levels of burnout. Hybrid Work shows a high rate of anxiety, likely due to the transition between onsite and remote environments.\nRemote Work generally has lower depression levels, with more employees reporting \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; for mental health issues.\nVirtual Meetings \u0026amp; Work-Life Balance: There is a slight upward trend in work-life balance ratings for those attending 3-13 virtual meetings per week. Too many meetings may hurt work-life balance, suggesting that a moderate number of meetings is optimal.\nIndustry Support for Remote Work: Retail and Healthcare industries provide the most support for remote work, but employee satisfaction is lower in these sectors.\nConsulting and IT industries provide less support but have higher satisfaction rates among employees.\nExperience \u0026amp; Satisfaction with Remote Work: Entry-level employees show the highest satisfaction with remote work, but satisfaction declines slightly after 6 years of experience.\nExpert-level employees maintain high satisfaction rates overall.\nStress, Isolation, and Satisfaction: Low stress correlates with low social isolation ratings, and these employees tend to be more satisfied with remote work.\nHigh stress and higher social isolation are linked to lower satisfaction with remote work.\nStress, Work Hours, and Productivity: Longer working hours and higher stress levels can sometimes boost productivity, but they also have the potential to decrease productivity. Physical Well-being and Stress:\nPoor sleep quality is common among employees with high stress levels, even if they exercise regularly, indicating that sleep is a critical factor in managing stress.\nWork Environment \u0026amp; Work-Life Balance: Onsite work typically leads to the highest work hours, while remote work consistently provides better work-life balance ratings across various job roles.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/remote-work-on-mental-health/","summary":"How different work environments (onsite, hybrid, and remote) affect employees\u0026rsquo; mental health, stress levels, work-life balance, and productivity across various industries.","title":"Remote Work on Mental Health"},{"content":"Store Opening Toolkit Introduction The \u0026ldquo;Store Opening Toolkit\u0026rdquo; provides a comprehensive toolset for potential business owners looking to open physical stores, leveraging APIs like Google Maps, Yelp Fusion, and OpenAI to generate location-specific recommendations for shop openings.\nClick the GitHub Repository for more details!\nKey Insights Business Use Case: The toolkit aims to assist shop owners in making informed decisions about opening physical stores by analyzing key location data, such as traffic patterns, competitor presence, and average operational hours, specifically using an ice cream shop as an example.\nAPIs Utilized: Google Maps API: Provides data on popular places, traffic-heavy locations, and business hours.\nYelp Fusion API: Offers insights into business ratings, locations, and customer reviews.\nOpenAI API: Used to generate recommendations based on gathered data.\nBusiness Strategy: The toolkit generates location-specific strategies for opening ice cream shops, considering factors like foot traffic, popular areas, and the competition in nearby regions.\nRecommendations also cover operational hours, pricing strategies, and target audiences, offering tailored solutions for different locations in San Francisco.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/store-opening-toolkit/","summary":"A comprehensive toolset for potential business owners looking to open physical stores, leveraging APIs like Google Maps, Yelp Fusion, and OpenAI to generate location-specific recommendations for shop openings.","title":"Store Opening Toolkit"}]
