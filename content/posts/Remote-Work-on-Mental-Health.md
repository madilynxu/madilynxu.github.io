## Key Insights

- **Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health**:
Onsite Work leads to the highest levels of burnout.

Hybrid Work shows a high rate of anxiety, likely due to the transition between onsite and remote environments.

Remote Work generally has lower depression levels, with more employees reporting "None" for mental health issues.

- **Virtual Meetings & Work-Life Balance**:
There is a slight upward trend in work-life balance ratings for those attending 3-13 virtual meetings per week.

Too many meetings may hurt work-life balance, suggesting that a moderate number of meetings is optimal.

- **Industry Support for Remote Work**:

Retail and Healthcare industries provide the most support for remote work, but employee satisfaction is lower in these sectors.

Consulting and IT industries provide less support but have higher satisfaction rates among employees.

- **Experience & Satisfaction with Remote Work**:

Entry-level employees show the highest satisfaction with remote work, but satisfaction declines slightly after 6 years of experience.

Expert-level employees maintain high satisfaction rates overall.

- **Stress, Isolation, and Satisfaction**:

Low stress correlates with low social isolation ratings, and these employees tend to be more satisfied with remote work.

High stress and higher social isolation are linked to lower satisfaction with remote work.

- **Stress, Work Hours, and Productivity**:

Longer working hours and higher stress levels can sometimes boost productivity, but they also have the potential to decrease productivity.
Physical Well-being and Stress:

Poor sleep quality is common among employees with high stress levels, even if they exercise regularly, indicating that sleep is a critical factor in managing stress.

- **Work Environment & Work-Life Balance**:

Onsite work typically leads to the highest work hours, while remote work consistently provides better work-life balance ratings across various job roles.
